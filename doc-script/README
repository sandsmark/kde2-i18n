This directory contains the scripts used for the statistic of the
KDE documentation, which can be found at:
      http://mimas.germany.net:8080/kde-doc/
The script consists of three kinds of files:
- checkDoc.pm the engine behind all
- common.pm the things that probably won't need changes
- checkDoc-XX the calling programm for each language
- comments.dat: If you want to add a comment to a file
  (english original or translated one)

The checkDoc-* PERL scripts are executed daily,
and and its output is available at:
   http://mimas.germany.net:8080/kde-doc/html/doc-XX.html,
   where XX is cs, da, pt, ptBr etc.

if you want to add an additional language, simply create a new checkDoc-XX file,
in order to have a link on the start page, you have to drop me a note.

CHANGE LOG
99-7-16
  Added optional support of comments (see German file, experimental)
99--7-14
  Added a link to the statistics of the PO(T) files
99--7-12
  Added Slovenian (sl)
  Updated French i18n website address

TODO:
-- The 'others' section must be uptated to reflect the new directory structure
-- support of subdirectory search in the single modules in order to catch some
   files. (In the main KDE modules such as base etc. shouldn't IMO any html/sgml
   files outside of <module>/doc/)
   In the kdenonbeta module the algorithm must be smart enough to find the
   sgml/html files itself
-- Take care of the files in kde-i18n/en/docs/
-- some cleaning must be done too.
