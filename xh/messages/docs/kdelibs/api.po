"An important goal of KDE is to make applications usable by people in many "
"countries. Internationalization (often abbreviated as <abbrev>i18n</abbrev>"
", which stands for &quot;I&quot;, then eighteen letters, then &quot;n&quot;) "
"comprises preparation for the translation of labels and messages appearing "
"in the user interface, support for input, output and string manipulation in "
"various character sets, support for different date, time and currency "
"formats. In the end, a program should be able to run "
"<emphasis>unmodified</emphasis>"
"in any linguistic environment with any set of cultural conventions."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:85
msgid ""
"Thanks to their foundation Qt 2.x, KDE programs by default use the powerful "
"<classname>QString</classname> class for all user-visible strings. As "
"<classname>QString</classname>"
" uses Unicode internally, in most cases you do not have to worry about "
"unusual charsets. Whereever you have to use a local encoding (e. g. for "
"filenames), Qt provides the <classname>QTextCodec</classname> class for "
"conversion."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:94
msgid ""
"In the following we discuss how you prepare a program for the translation of "
"its user interface. If you are a programmer of an application in the KDE "
"CVS, you have luck, and you only have to care for marking all translatable "
"strings. The translation itself will be taken care of by an army of diligent "
"daemons known as the KDE Translation Team. If you are maintaining an "
"application yourself, you have to take a look at these issues involved from "
"the translator's point of view as well."

"KDE programs normally use a translation system based on a modified form of "
"the gettext package which is part of glibc on Linux systems. Although this "
"is not mandatory, it is recommended because it is very easy to use for the "
"programmer and it is <emphasis>the</emphasis> standard for open source "
"projects. If you take care of enclosing all translatable strings in the "
"source code with a call to <function>i18n()</function> (and include the "
"header file <filename>klocale.h</filename>), you are almost done. For "
"example, in order to construct a label within a dialog, write:"
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:118
msgid ""
"#include &lt;klocale.h&gt;\n"
"...\n"
"QLabel *lbl = new QLabel(i18n(\"File name:\"), this);"
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:126
msgid ""
"The <function>i18n()</function> function has two aspects: The first is, it "
"takes an argument of type <type>const char *</type>, looks it up in its "
"dictionary - according to the user's preferred language, as set in the "
"control center - and returns a <classname>QString</classname> with the "
"translation. As a technical sidenote, note that the lookup is in fact very "
"fast, and its memory usage is optimized by mapping a binary translation file "
"directly into memory. Also, as the result of the function is an implicitly "
"shared <classname>QString</classname>"
" object, you do not have to worry about superfluous deep copies of the "
"string."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:137
msgid ""
"The other aspect of this function is that is marks the strings to be "
"translated in the source code, so they can be automatically extracted with "
"the program <application>xgettext</application>. In order to use it, put "
"this rule into the <filename>Makefile.am</filename> of your "
"<application>foo</application> package:"

"Often you want to display a string which contains some elements which are "

msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:173
msgid ""
"QString filename;\n"
"...\n"
"filename = ... // get a file name from the user or from somewhere else\n"

"i18n(\" does not exist.));\n"

"Do not produce word puzzles like this! It makes the translator's life "
"unnecessarily hard. It is better to use phrases which make sense for "
"themselves and substitute the variable element with the "
"<function>arg()</function> method of <classname>QString</classname>:"

"QString filename;\n"

"The method <function>arg()</function> takes substrings of the form "
"&quot;&percnt;n&quot;, where <replaceable>n</replaceable> is a number "
"between 0 and 9, and replaces the one with the lowest number with its "
"argument. For convenience, this method is overloaded for integers and "
"floats, so in contrast to c-like functions like "
"<function>sprintf()</function>, it is typesafe. It also has the important "
"advantage that when you have several insertions in a string, the translator "
"has the freedom the change their order. For example, consider the english "
"phrase <blockquote><para>Printed &percnt;1 pages of &percnt;2 "
"total.</para></blockquote> A german translator could now use as a "
"translation <blockquote><para>Von insgesamt &percnt;2 Seiten wurden "
"&percnt;1 gedruckt.</para></blockquote>"
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:216
msgid ""
"Sometimes, it turns out that a word which must be translated is ambigous, "
"i.e. it has several meanings in the original (which is normally english). "
"For example, you may have a button with the label &quot;Set&quot; on it. One "
"possible meaning is &quot;A set of elements&quot; which a german translator "
"would substitute with &quot;Menge&quot;. Another meaning is &quot;Set an "
"option&quot; which a german translator would substitute with "
"&quot;Setzen&quot;. Obviously, the <function>i18n()</function> described "
"above can not provide different results for the same phrase in different "
"contexts. A way around this is an overloaded two-argument version of this "
"function. The second argument is the untranslated string, which is used for "
"english users. The first argument only serves the purpose of distinguishing "
"different meanings of the untranslated string. In the above example, you can "
"use <blockquote><para> i18n(\"A set of\", \"Set\") </para></blockquote> for "
"one occurance of &quot;Set&quot; and <blockquote><para> i18n(\"to set\", "
"\"Set\") </para></blockquote> for the other one."
