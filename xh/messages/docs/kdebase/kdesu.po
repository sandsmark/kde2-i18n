"Instead of executing the user command directly with "

"user's program. The information passed over is: the X display, an X "

"Allowing &kdesu; to remember passwords opens up a (small) security "

"&kdesu; uses a daemon, called <application>kdesud</application>. The "
"daemon listens to a UNIX socket in <filename>/tmp</filename> for "
"commands. The mode of the socket is 0600 so that only your user id "
"can connect to it. If password keeping is enabled, &kdesu; executes "
"commands through this daemon. It writes the command and root's "
"password to the socket and the daemon executes the command using "
"\"<command>su</command>\", as describe before. After this, the "
"command and the password are not thrown away. Instead, they are kept "
"for a specified amount of time. This is the timeout value from in "
"the control module. If another request for the same command is "
"coming within this time period, the client does not have to supply "
"the password. To keep hackers who broke into your account from "
"stealing passwords from the daemon (for example, by attaching a "
"debugger), the daemon is installed set-group-id nogroup. This should "
"prevent all normal users (including you) from getting passwords from "
"the <application>kdesud</application> process. Also, the daemon sets "
"the <envar>DISPLAY</envar> environment variable to the value it had "
"when it was started. The only thing a hacker can do is execute an "
"application on your display."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:331

"One weak spot in this scheme is that the programs you execute are "
"probably not written with security in mind (like setuid root "

"problems and a hacker could exploit those."
