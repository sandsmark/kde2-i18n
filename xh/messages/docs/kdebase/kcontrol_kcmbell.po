"It isn't always possible for the X server to actually make a beep sound with "
"exactly the parameters selected due to hardware limitations. For example, on "
"most PCs, volume control is not very good so the X server seems to fake low "
"volume with a reduced duration of the sound. Thus, if the settings don't "
"seem to do anything, this is because the X server and/or the hardware don't "
"support anything better."
