"This option allows you to change the relationship between the distance that "

"pointing device.)<p> A high value for the acceleration will lead to large "
"movements of the mouse pointer on the screen even when you only make a small "
"movement with the physical device. Selecting very high values may result in "
"the mouse pointer flying across the screen, making it hard to control!<p> "

"The threshold is the smallest distance that the mouse pointer must move on "
"the screen before acceleration has any effect. If the movement is smaller "
"than the threshold, the mouse pointer moves as if the acceleration was set "
"to 1X.<p> Thus, when you make small movements with the physical device, "
"there is no acceleration at all, giving you a greater degree of control over "
"the mouse pointer. With larger movements of the physical device, you can "
"move the mouse pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen.<p> You can "
"set the threshold value by dragging the slider button or by clicking the "
"up/down arrows on the spin-button to the left of the slider."
