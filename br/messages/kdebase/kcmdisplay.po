"<h1>Colors</h1> This module allows you to choose the color scheme used for "
"the KDE desktop. The different elements of the desktop, such as title bars, "
"menu text, etc., are called \"widgets\". You can choose the widget whose "
"color you want to change by selecting it from a list, or by clicking on a "
"graphic representation of the desktop.<p> You can save color settings as "
"complete color schemes, which can also be modified or deleted. KDE comes "
"with several predefined color schemes on which you can base your own.<p> All "
"KDE applications will obey the selected color scheme. Non-KDE applications "
"may also obey some or all of the color settings. See the \"Style\" control "
