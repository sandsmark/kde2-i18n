"The Samba and NFS Status Monitor is a front end to the programs "
"<em>smbstatus</em> and <em>showmount</em>. Smbstatus reports on current "
"Samba connections, and is part of the suite of Samba tools, which implements "
"the SMB (Session Message Block) protocol, also called the NetBIOS or "
"LanManager protocol. This protocol can be used to provide printer sharing or "
"drive sharing services on a network including machines running the various "
"flavors of Microsoft Windows.<p> Showmount is part of the NFS software "
"package. NFS stands for Network File System and is the traditional UNIX way "
"to share directories over the network. In this case the output of "
"<em>showmount -a localhost</em> is parsed. On some systems showmount is in "
"/usr/sbin, check if you have showmount in your PATH."
