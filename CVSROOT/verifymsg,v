@# The "verifymsg" file is used to allow verification of logging
# information.  It works best when a template (as specified in the
# rcsinfo file) is provided for the logging procedure.  Given a
# template with locations for, a bug-id number, a list of people who
# reviewed the code before it can be checked in, and an external
# process to catalog the differences that were code reviewed, the
# following test can be applied to the code:
#
#   Making sure that the entered bug-id number is correct.
#   Validating that the code that was reviewed is indeed the code being
#       checked in (using the bug-id number or a seperate review
#       number to identify this particular code set.).
#
# If any of the above test failed, then the commit would be aborted.
#
# Actions such as mailing a copy of the report to each reviewer are
# better handled by an entry in the loginfo file.
#
# One thing that should be noted is the the ALL keyword is not
# supported.  There can be only one entry that matches a given
# repository.
