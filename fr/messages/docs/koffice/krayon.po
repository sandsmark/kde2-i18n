"&krayon; is a full featured image manipulation program. You can use &krayon; "
"for all your image creation and editing needs, such as making web images, "

"What makes &krayon; different, and special, is ease of use compared with "
"other high-end applications, and full integration with &koffice; and &kde;. "
"Because of this, &krayon; supports drag and drop, themes, embedding, and "
"many other advanced features you expect from a modern desktop environment. "
"Ease of use is important to amateur users, but even more important to "
"professional artists who must spend many hours a day using such applications "
"to work with images."

"&krayon; is primarily a painting program with some image processing "
"capabilities. More capabilities can be added with plugins. Using native and "
"foreign plugins, and parts which can reuse other &kde; components, "
"additional tools and utilities can be added as needed."

"&krayon; uses &XML; as its native file format. This allows import filters "
"for almost every type of image file format to be easily created. It also "
"allows other programs to more easily import &krayon; files."
