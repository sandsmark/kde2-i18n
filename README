What it is
----------

Do you wonder what i18n stands for?  Just count the letters between the
first I and the last N in the word "internationalization" ...

i18n directories
----------------

For every KDE supported language there is one directory that contains *.po
files as well as translated documentation files (*.docbook). To enjoy the
translated programs and languages, one has to install the files from the
respective directory and select Control Center -> Personalization -> Country
& Language -> Language.

As long as no locale is installed, all programs and documentation appear in
english.

You don't need to install all locales, just select the directory you want.

template directory
------------------

The template directory contains templates that only translater might use. Please
have a look at the KBabel program from the kdesdk package for further information.
