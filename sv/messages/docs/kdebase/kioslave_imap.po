"The IMAP4rev1 protocol (Internet Message Access Protocol) allows to access "
"messages in mail folders on a server. Unlike POP3, which is designed to "
"download the mails and delete them from the server, the purpose of IMAP is "
"to store all mails on the server to be able to access these mails from "
"everywhere. Messages can be stored on the server, retrieved from there or "
"moved between folders."

"folders and files on a local file system."
