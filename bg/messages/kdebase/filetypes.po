"<h1>File Associations</h1> This module allows you to choose which "
"applications are associated with a given type of file. File types are also "
"referred to MIME types (MIME is an acronym which stands for \"Multipurpose "
"Internet Mail Extensions\".)<p> A file association consists of the "
"following: <ul><li>Rules for determining the MIME-type of a file. For "
"example, the filename pattern *.kwd, which means 'all files with names that "
"end in .kwd', is associated with the MIME type \"x-kword\".</li> <li>"
"A short description of the MIME-type. For example, the description of the "
"MIME type \"x-kword\" is simply 'KWord document'.)</li> <li>An icon to be "
"used for displaying files of the given MIME-type, so that you can easily "
"identify the type of file, say in a Konqueror view (at least for the types "
"you use often!)</li> <li>A list of the applications which can be used to "
"open files of the given MIME-type. If more than one application can be used, "
"then the list is ordered by priority.</li></ul>"
" You may be surprised to find that some MIME types have no associated "
"filename patterns! In these cases, Konqueror is able to determine the "
"MIME-type by directly examining the contents of the file."
