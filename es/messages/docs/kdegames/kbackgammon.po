"&kbackgammon; is a graphical backgammon program. The objective of backgammon "
"is to move your checkers off the board before your opponent does. While the "
"rules of backgammon are moderately difficult (the most difficult part "
"apparently being the initial positioning of the checkers), this document "
"does not try to teach these rules: please refer to the Web, a book, or "
"(probably best) a friend for this."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:71
msgid ""
"&kbackgammon; offers you a graphical backgammon board that can be used "
"almost entirely by using the mouse (although textual commands are also "
"available and it should be possible to play backgammon without the mouse, "
"too). Therefore, &kbackgammon; is easy to use and allows you to concentrate "
"on the important aspects of playing backgammon."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:78
msgid ""
"In order to play backgammon, you usually need an opponent. &kbackgammon; "
"offers you to play against hundreds of different opponents of various "
"strength on the <ulink url=\"http://www.fibs.com/\">First Internet "
"Backgammon Server</ulink>. If you prefer, you may also use the <link "
"linkend=\"engine-offline\">Offline Engine</link> which allows you to play "
"against yorself or friends that are with you at your computer."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:87
msgid ""
"In the near future &kbackgammon; will allow you to play against <link "
"linkend=\"engine-gnubg\">&GNU; Backgammon</link>, which is a powerful "
"backgammon program that usually runs without a graphical frontend. It plays "
"on <acronym>FIBS</acronym> with a rating of about 2000 (which is quite high)."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:93
msgid ""
"Additionally, plans are on the way that will allow games over the Internet "
"between two &kbackgammon; programs (and their respective users). Finally, "
"the architecture of &kbackgammon; is quite open and it is possible to "
"include support for other engines easily (if you are interested in this, "

"&kbackgammon; is centered around a graphical backgammon board. This board "

"If it is their turn to move, players can move checkers by clicking on them "
"and moving the mouse pointer to the desired location (while holding the "
"mouse button continuously pressed). This is called dragging the checker. "
"Depending on the selection made in the current <link "
"linkend=\"engines\">engine's</link> <link "
"linkend=\"prefs\">configuration</link>, the move will be finished once the "
"maximum number of checkers has been moved (this may be anywhere between 1 "
"and 4 checkers, although it will usually be 2 checkers)."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:148
msgid ""
"In addition to dragging the checkers, the board offers a feature called "
"\"short move feature\". If this has been enabled in the board's "
"configuration menu, checkers can be moved by simply clicking on them. The "
"board will then automatically make the shortest move possible away from the "
"current field. If the \"short move feature\" <link linkend=\"prefs\">is "
"enabled</link>"
", it may be set to single or double click. This option is very useful for "
"users of touchpads that are sometimes difficult to use for dragging."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:158
msgid ""
"Finally, the board has a certain smartness: it will only accept moves that "
"are allowed (based on the current dice). While the <link "
"linkend=\"engine-offline\">offline engine</link> allows this to be switched "
"off (for the <guilabel>Edit Mode</guilabel>), this is usually very helpful "
"for unexperienced users (and advanced players will probably never notice "
"this). This featue can also be used to cancel a move in progress: just drop "
"it over an illegal field."
