"&ksame; is a simple game. It is played by one player, so there is only one "
"winner :-) You play for fun and against the high score. It has been inspired "
"by SameGame, which is only really famous on the Macintosh."

"You can erase same marbles when they are connected vertically or "
"horizontally when you click them. If there are pieces over the erased ones, "
"they will drop down. If all of the pieces on the vertical line are erased, "
"all pieces on the right side will slide to the left."

msgid ""
"As an example, if you erase 7 balls, then you get 25 points (7 minus 2 = 5. "

"Get as many of the same pieces as you can, and then erase them in one click. "

"The score will then be decreased according to the number of remaining "
