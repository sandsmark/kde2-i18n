"&pixie; is an image manager for &kde;. It can be used as a simple, quick "
"viewer and editor for images, but it can also be used for managing large "
"numbers of image \"thumbnails\". It currently offers over 30 image effects "
"and enhancements, as well as extensive color editing for both image-wide and "
"individual colors. Web designers will find &pixie; particularly useful, as "
"it can play animated GIFs and supports transparency. It also offers quick "
