"&ksysguard; is the KDE Task Manager and Performance Monitor. It features a "
"client server architecture that allows monitoring of local as well as remote "
"hosts. The graphical front end uses so called sensors to retrieve the "
"information it displays. A sensor can return simple values or more complex "
"information like tables. For each type of information one or more displays "
"are provided. Displays are organized in work sheets that can be saved and "
"loaded independantly from each other. So &ksysguard; is not only a simple "
"task manager but also a very powerful tool to control large server farms."
