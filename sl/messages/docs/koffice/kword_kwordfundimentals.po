"When we sit down to write a document, we already have an idea of what the "

"want a document with only one column, which goes all the way across the "
"page, and from top to bottom of the page. When you sit down to author a "
"newsletter for a local organization, however, you may want a large title "
"across the top, and several columns for quick news articles."

#: index.docbook:82
msgid ""
"With &kword;, you can use this predetermined notion of how your document "
"should look too make your work easier. By using a template, you can create a "
"set of frames to approximate this final layout. For your business letter, "
"you can select one large frame that covers the page from top to bottom and "
"side to side (excluding margins of course). For that newsletter, however, "
"you may decide that a two or three column document is more to your liking. "
"Once you select this template, &kword; will create the frames for you."

"This is not a problem. If you begin your document as a single column "
"document and decide later that two columns is better for your needs, you can "
"add another column. The purpose of templates is not to limit your ability to "
"change your layout, but rather to take some of the work load off you "
"whenever possible. Choosing the correct template when you begin your "
"document will simplify the formatting (as opposed to always selecting the "
"default template and making your changes later.), but it is also important "
"to remember that choosing the wrong template will not limit your work."

"The Text Oriented templates are designed to act like page-oriented word "
"processors. When you select a Text Oriented template, you will create a "
"template with one or more frames. The first frame is distinctly tied to the "
"paper size of your document. When you increase or decrease the paper size or "
"change the margins, the frame size is automatically adjusted. You are "
"<emphasis>not</emphasis> able to move this frame around on the page and you "
"cannot delete this frame. If you need to adjust the size or position of this "
"frame, you must <link linkend=\"page-format\">adjust the margins</link>. On "
"top of the first frame, you can, of course, add additional frames. These "
"frames can contain pictures, text or whatever you want. These new frames can "
"be moved, re-sized and deleted to suit your needs. If you want it, &kword; "
"will even wrap the text from the first frame around any information in any "
"subsequent frames."

"These templates are designed for desktop publishing. When you select a "
"template from this class, all of the frames are created equal. This is where "
"the difference between Page Layout and Text Oriented template lies. None of "
"the frames in a Page Layout template are tied to the page as tightly as the "
"main frame in a Text Oriented template is. Each of the frames is independent "
"of the page size, and can be moved or re-sized without changing margins, "
"&etc; Of course this also means that altering the margins or paper size of "
"your document requires that you individually move/resize each frame."
