"<h1>Enhanced Browsing</h1> In this module you can configure some enhanced "
"browsing features of KDE. <h2>Internet Keywords</h2>Internet Keywords let "
"you type in the name of a brand, a project, a celebrity, etc... and go to "
"the relevant location. For example you can just type \"KDE\" or \"K Desktop "
"Environment\" in Konqueror to go to KDE's homepage.<h2>Web Shortcuts</h2>"
"Web Shortcuts are a quick way of using Web search engines. For example, type "
"\"altavista:frobozz\" or \"av:frobozz\" and Konqueror will do a search on "
"AltaVista for \"frobozz\". Even easier: just press Alt-F2 (if you haven't "
"changed this shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the KDE Run Command dialog."
