"<h1>Energy Saving For Display</h1> If your display supports power saving "
"features, you can configure them using this module.<p> There are three "
"levels of power saving: standby, suspend, and off. The greater the level of "
"power saving, the longer it takes for the display to return to an active "
"state.<p> To wake up the display from a power saving mode, you can make a "
"small movement with the mouse, or press a key that is not likely to cause "
"any unintended side-effects, for example, the \"shift\" key."
