"<h1>Passwords</h1> This module gives you options for configuring the way in "
"which the \"kdesu\" program treats passwords. Kdesu will ask you for a "
"password when you try to carry out some privileged actions, such as changing "
"the date/time stored in your system clock, or adding new users on your "
"computer.<p> You can configure the type of visual feedback given when you "
"type a password, and whether kdesu should remember passwords for some time "
"after you have given them.<p> Note that these settings affect <em>only</em> "
"kdesu. This means that the behavior of passwords in KMail and other programs "
"cannot be configured here."
