"Normally, the sound server defaults to using the device called "

"exception is for instance if you are using devfs, then you should use "
"<b>/dev/sound/dsp</b> instead. Other alternatives are things like "
"<b>/dev/dsp0</b> or <b>/dev/dsp1</b> if you have a soundcard that supports "

"Hz here, if you are using <b>old SoundBlaster cards</b>, like SoundBlaster "
