"<h1>Style</h1> In this module you can configure how your KDE applications "
"will look.<p> Styles and themes affect the way buttons, menus etc. are drawn "
"in KDE.  Think of styles as plugins that provide a general look for KDE and "
"of themes as a way to fine-tune those styles. E.g. you might use the "
"\"System\" style but use a theme that provides a color gradient or a marble "
"texture.<p> Apart from styles and themes you can configure here the behavior "
"of menubars and toolbars."
