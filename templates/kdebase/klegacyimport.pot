"<QT><b>Legacy Theme Importer</b><P>KDE now supports utilizing older themes "
"from other platforms in your new KDE desktop. The most common type of legacy "
"theme is for the GTK toolkit, which is imported to KDE's Control Center with "
"this utility.<P>In order to do this you must specify at least one item: the "
"folder where the pixmaps for the theme is located. You may also have to "
"specify the theme's gtkrc file if it's not in the same folder as the "
"pixmaps. Both are usually in the folder \"gtk\" inside the theme's "
"directory.</QT>"
