"<h1>Background</h1> This module allows you to control the appearance of the "
"virtual desktops. KDE offers a variety of options for customization, "
"including the ability to specify different settings for each virtual "
"desktop, or a common background for all of them.<p> The appearance of the "
"desktop results from the combination of its background colors and patterns, "
"and optionally, wallpaper, which is based on the image from a graphic "
"file.<p> The background can be made up of a single color, or a pair of "
"colors which can be blended in a variety of patterns. Wallpaper is also "
"customizable, with options for tiling and stretching images. The wallpaper "
"can be overlaid opaquely, or blended in different ways with the background "
"colors and patterns.<p> KDE allows you to have the wallpaper change "
"automatically at specified intervals of time. You can also replace the "
"background with a program that updates the desktop dynamically. For example, "
"the \"kdeworld\" program shows a day/night map of the world which is updated "
"periodically."
