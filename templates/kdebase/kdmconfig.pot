"<h1>Login Manager</h1> In this module you can configure the various aspects "

"Control Center with superuser rights (which is the completely right thing to "
"do, by the way), click on the <em>Modify</em> button to acquire superuser "
"rights. You will be asked for the superuser password.<h2>Appearance</h2> On "
"this tab page, you can configure how the Login Manager should look, which "
"language it should use, and which GUI style it should use. The language "
"settings made here have no influence on the user's language "
"settings.<h2>Font</h2>Here you can choose the fonts that the Login Manager "
"should use for various purposes like greetings and user names. "
"<h2>Background</h2>If you want to set a special background for the login "
"screen, this is where to do it.<h2>Sessions</h2> Here you can specify which "
"types of sessions the Login Manager should offer you for logging in and who "
"is allowed to shutdown/reboot the machine.<h2>Users</h2>On this tab page, "
"you can select which users the Login Manager will offer you for logging "
"in.<h2>Convenience</h2> Here you can specify a user to be logged in "
"automatically, users not needing to provide a password to log in, and other "
"features ideal for lazy people. ;-)"
