"<h1>Screen saver</h1> This module allows you to enable and configure a "
"screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power "
"saving features enabled for your display.<p> Besides providing an endless "
"variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also "
"gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it "
"unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the screen, "
"make sure you enable the \"Require password\" feature of the screen saver. "
"If you don't, you can still explicitly lock the screen using the desktop's "
"\"Lock Screen\" action."
