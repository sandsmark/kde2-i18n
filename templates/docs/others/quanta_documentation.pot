msgid "&quantaplus; is an ambitious open souce project. Early on some of our very first developers did not even think it would need a help section as it was so intuitive... While I appreciate the optimisim (and our code slinging hero may be the exception) we wish to attempt to provide a substantial resource here. Documentation is often the last thing to be done in open source projects. We would like to step up the level here."

Probably the greatest being a feeling they do not have the skills. This documentation is writting in HTML... so if you can do that you can help. What is the open source <emphasis>cause</emphasis>? It is giving back to the community to grow something bigger than we could on our own, but it is also a shining hope for those people around the world where getting software for free is not an option, it is <emphasis>the</emphasis> option.
