msgid "Why work from a text based editor? Because static (dead) web pages are quickly fading into obscurity. In their place are PHP, Zope, ASP, HTML::Mason and other forms of dynamic pages. Our personal focus is PHP but &quanta; can be extended for any development language. PHP can be as simple as a few tags in your HTML, full of tags, using templates, classes and cached pages... all hooked to databases and becoming chameleon like in selectable styles. Like we say... static HTML is going the way of the dinosaur and we are working to build the tool to make you more productive than you ever could be drawing pictures. Stay tuned!"
