#: index.docbook:85
msgid	"&kmix; usage is straightforward. Every mixer device that your "
	"soundcard provides is represented by a volume slider. Mono devices "
	"have a single slider, stereo devices can have either one or two "
	"sliders, depending on your choice. Additionaly there is a panning "
	"slider at the bottom of the &kmix; window. If you have multiple "
	"soundcards, they will each have their own tab."

	"volume of the right speaker, dragging it to the right vice versa. Of "
