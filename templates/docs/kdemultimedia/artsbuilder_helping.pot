	"don't have to be a developer to contribute. We can also use help "
	"from testers to submit bug reports, translators to translate the "
	"application text and documentation into other languages, artists to "
	"design bitmaps (especially for "
	"<application>artsbuilder</application> modules), musicians to create "
