The first, gcc-3.0 bug c++/2733 is relatively harmless (and has to do with problems with the asm statement). It breaks compilation of convert.cc. It has been fixed in the gcc-3.0 CVS, and will no longer be a problem with gcc-3.0.1 and higher. A workaround has also been added to the CVS version of KDE/aRts."

#: index.docbook:370
