msgid	"How does autoscaling work?"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:326
msgid	"Glad you asked. Since there is no sensible predetermined scaling "
	"factor for paging/swapping operations and context switches (unlike "
	"&eg; memory utilisation, where you can take the total memory size as "
	"baseline), &ktimemon; uses a semi-intelligent (well, ...) "
	"autoscaling mechanism. Autoscaling works as follows:"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:334
msgid	"Each of the three bar graphs as described in the <link "
	"linkend=\"xtndmode\">extended mode section</link> has an associated "
	"scaling factor. The initial values of these factors are set to some "
	"predetermined value."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:334
msgid	"Each time a new sample is displayed, the respective value is "
	"tentatively scaled with the corresponding factor. If the value can "
	"be displayed in the scale chosen by the factor, no change occurs "
	"(&ie; small changes in the activity are reflected by a changing "
	"height of the bar)."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:334
msgid	"If the scaled value would be either too large or too small to be "
	"displayed with the current scaling factor, the scaling is adjusted "
	"so that the new value displayed is roughly halfway up the bar graph. "
	"Thus, subsequent changes should have a good chance of getting "
	"displayed relative to the current value, without having to change "
	"the scale again."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:366
msgid	"Why does a message box with <errorname>diaglostic output from child "
	"command</errorname> pop up?"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:372
msgid	"If you bind a mouse button to an external command as described in "
	"the <link linkend=\"config\">Configuration</link> chapter, "
	"&ktimemon; does not check for a valid command name. Instead a "
	"command shell is invoked to execute the statement, so shell "
	"commands, environment variables and more can be used. To allow some "
	"feedback to the user, &ktimemon; monitors the "
	"<systemitem>stderr</systemitem> output of the command shell, and "
	"reports it in this message box."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:382
msgid	"While this scheme can be helpful in case a command is not found, it "
	"can be quite annoying if the invoked command prints harmless "
	"diagnostic information on <systemitem>stderr</systemitem>. A simple "
	"and elegant solution to this problem is to add "
	"<userinput>2&gt;/dev/null</userinput> at the end of the command "
	"specification. This redirects diagnostic messages to message "
