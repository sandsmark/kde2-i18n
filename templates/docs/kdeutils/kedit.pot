It is a small editor which can be used with &konqueror; for text and configuration file browsing. &kedit; also serves well for creating small plain text documents. It is not meant to be a programmers editor, in particular it is not meant to replace any of the more powerful editors such as &kate;, <application>XEmacs</application> or <application>Emacs</application>. &kedit;'s functionality will intentionally remain rather limited to ensure a reasonably fast start."
