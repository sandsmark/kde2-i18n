msgid "&kljettool; is a program that lets you adjust your &Hewlett-Packard; Laserjet operating parameters. Some of &Hewlett-Packard;'s printers such as the 5L or the 6L do no longer have a hardware control panel and the printer is controlled completely by software. However this software is often available only for the &Windows; platform. &kljettool; seeks to fill the need for such software on the &UNIX; platform. It should work with any printer that understands &Hewlett-Packard;'s <acronym>PJL</acronym> ( Printer Job Language). However some features may have no effect on your particular model."

The filter runs the program <command>file</command> on the file to be printed and <command>file</command> will tell the <command>filter</command> script what sort of document we are dealing with. Then depending on the type of the document the right program is run to produce output in a format that the printer can understand.
