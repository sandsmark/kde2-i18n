msgid "&kdvi; is a plugin for the &kviewshell; program which allows &kviewshell; to display &DVI;-files (<literal role=\"extension\">.dvi</literal>) which are produced by the TeX typesetting system. &kdvi; supports many extensions of the DVI standard, for instance the inclusion of &PostScript; graphics or hyperlinks. More details, examples and all the technical specifications can be found in the file <ulink url=\"KDVI-features.dvi\"><filename>KDVI-features.dvi</filename></ulink> (click <ulink url=\"KDVI-features.tex\">here</ulink> for the TeX-source of that file)."

msgid "&kdvi; can print your DVI-files using the standard KDE printing interface. Internally, &kdvi; uses the programm <command>dvips</command> to generate PostScript, which is then passed on to the printer. In particular, <command>dvips</command> must be installed if you want to print with &kdvi;. The programm <command>dvips</command> uses its own configuration files and its own settings, which are fine for most purposes. However, if you care for optimal printing results, you should configure <command>dvips</command> manually and make sure to set a default MetaFont mode which fits your printer best ---on many systems you'll find a <ulink url=\"info:/dvips\">GNU-texinfo documentation of <command>dvips</command></ulink>, and you might also want to look for a file called <filename>dvips.dvi</filename> or similar."

msgid "What happens when &kdvi; displays the message \"Generating bitmap fonts\", and why does the procedure take so long?"
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:308
msgid "Many of the fonts which are typically used in a TeX document must be generated by the MetaFont system. Metafont is a language similar to TeX (included in most TeX distributions) which takes a description of the font outline, and produces a rasterized version (= <filename>.pk</filename>-file) of the font which can then be send to a printer or be used in a previewing program like &kdvi;. Metafont goes out of its way to produce the best possible output for your printer. For instance, it knows that a pixel of an inkjet printer is a roundisch blot, and that nearby pixels tend to smear into each other. In contrast, a pixel on a laser printer is rectangular, but an isolated pixel is very often not rendered at all."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:322
msgid "Generating such highly optimized bitmap fonts is naturally rather time-consuming, in particular since typical TeX documents use a large number of different fonts. We can only ask for your patience. To ease the matter somewhat, most distributions of TeX store the <filename>.pk</filename>-files for a limited time, e.g. 100 days. Therefore, if you access the same document more than once, the <filename>.pk</filename> files will be reused."
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:336
msgid "What is a MetaFont Mode?"
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:339
msgid "In order to produce bitmap fonts which are optimized for your printer (see the answer to the first question), Metafont comes with a database of printing engines --look for a file called <filename>modes.mf</filename>. A Metafont Mode is just the name of a database entry. For example, the name \"ljfour\" refers to the entry in the database that describes a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4 printer. A MetaFont Mode is usually followed by a number, the resolution. The LaserJet, for instance canprint in both 300 and 600 dots per inch. Thus, \"ljfour/600\" would be a full description."
