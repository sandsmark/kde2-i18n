msgid	"Internet Keywords make it easier for you to use well known names "

	"typing <userinput>http://www.kde.org/</userinput>, you can just type "

	"Environment</userinput>. The name you type will be resolved to a "

	"engine, you can configure KDE so that a pseudo "
	"<acronym>URL</acronym> scheme like <emphasis>gg</emphasis> will "
	"trigger a search on Google. This way, typing "

	"web shortcut here, whenever you type something that is not an "
	"Internet Keyword, your input will be passed to the selected web "
	"shortcut. This provides a very pleasant navigation and search "
	"experience, where Internet Keywords provide direct navigation, and "
	"you are in control of how to search for information when the "
	"Internet Keywords database does not contain the name you type. (If "
	"you select <guilabel>None</guilabel> then a directory listing of "
	"relevant Internet Keywords is provided instead.) Also, if you type "
	"something that starts with a question mark, as in <userinput>? "
	"KDE</userinput>, your input is directly passed to the web shortcut "
	"after stripping the question mark off, bypassing Internet Keywords "
