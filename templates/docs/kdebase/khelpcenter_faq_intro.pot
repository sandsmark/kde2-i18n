msgid "&kde; is the K Desktop Environment. It is a project initiated by <ulink url=\"mailto:ettrich@kde.org\">Matthias Ettrich</ulink> in 1996. The aim of the &kde; project is to connect the power of the &UNIX; operating systems with the comfort of a modern user interface."

msgid "On which platforms can I expect &kde; to work?"
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:33
msgid "&kde; is a Desktop Environment for all flavors of &UNIX;. While it is true that most &kde; developers use &Linux;, &kde; runs smoothly on a wide range of systems. You may, however, need to tweak the source code a bit to get &kde; to compile on a not-so-popular variant of &UNIX;, or if you are not using the &GNU; development tools, in particular the &gcc; compiler."

msgid "Is &kde; a window manager?"
msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:62
msgid "No, &kde; is not a window manager. While &kde; includes a very sophisticated window manager (&kwin;), &kde; is much more than that. It is a full-blown Integrated Desktop Environment."

#: index.docbook:65
msgid "&kde; provides a complete desktop environment, including a web browser, a file manager, a window manager, a help system, a configuration system, uncountable tools and utilities, and an ever increasing number of applications, including but not limited to mail and news clients, drawing programs, a &PostScript; and a &DVI; viewer and so forth."

msgstr ""

#: index.docbook:80
msgid "No, &kde; is not a clone. Specifically &kde; is not a <acronym>CDE</acronym> or &Windows; clone. While the &kde; developers have and will continue to glean the best features from all existing desktop environments, &kde; is a truly unique environment that has and will continue to go its own way."
