msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:61
msgid	"In the <guilabel>Panel Location</guilabel> frame you can choose "

	"that usually the available space is used more efficiently if the "
	"panel is aligned horizontally, &ie; attached to the top or bottom "

	"panel from one border to the other."

msgid	"Depending on your screen resolution you may find that the panel "

	"not been moved over it for a configurable amount of time. If you "
