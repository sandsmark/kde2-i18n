msgid	"This module is useful for any computer having a monitor labeled "
	"Energy Star Compliant. (Energy Star Compliant equipment is equipment "

	"when appropriate, without human intervention.)"
msgstr	""

msgid	"Energy Star Compliance can be applied to nearly any electrical "
	"device. This module, however, does not spin down hard drives, does "
	"not shutdown printers, <abbrev>etc.</abbrev> These settings only "
	"affect the behavior of your monitor."

#: index.docbook:45
msgid	"\"ON\", is the normal operation of your monitor while you are using "
	"it."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:48
msgid	"\"STANDBY\" is usually a minor power saving level. This setting "
	"usually involves blanking the screen, and not firing the electron "
	"gun, but keeping the electron gun \"energized\" and ready to go. "
	"When you need to use the monitor again, the monitor will come back "
	"on very quickly."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:54
msgid	"\"SUSPEND\" mode, is a very low power alternative. With most "
	"monitors, the screen is blanked, the electron gun is shut down, and "
	"the magnets that control the electron gun are powered down. While "
	"the power saving is substantial, to reactivate the monitor may take "
	"up to 10-15 seconds. The computer should always be able to return "
	"the monitor to On or Standby while in suspend mode.."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:61
msgid	"\"OFF\", usually means just that. The computer monitor is turned "
	"off. This usually means that the computer will not be able to turn "
	"the monitor back on by itself. Obviously, this keeps power "
	"consumption to a bare minimum (zero)."
