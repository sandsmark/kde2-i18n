#: index.docbook:74
msgid	"The first option you can enable on this page is <guilabel>Enable "
	"completion of forms</guilabel>. If you check this box, &konqueror; "
	"will try to remember what you answer to form questions, and will try "
	"to fill in forms for you with the answers you previously used."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:79
msgid	"You can configure the number of form items &konqueror; remembers "

msgid	"Of course, anything &konqueror; fills in a form with, you can still "

msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:86
msgid	"The next setting is <guilabel>Underline links</guilabel>. /ou can "
	"choose to underline links <guilabel>Always</guilabel>. If this "
	"option is selected, any text on web pages that acts as a link will "
	"be shown in an underlined font. While many web pages do use color to "
	"distinguish text that acts as a link, underlining makes it very easy "
	"to spot links."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:93
msgid	"If you don't like underlined links, you can choose "
	"<guilabel>Never</guilabel>, so that no links are underlined. Or you "
	"can choose a middle ground, <guilabel>Hover</guilabel>, so that "
	"links are underlined when the mouse cursor is resting over them, and "
	"not underlined the rest of the time."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:99
msgid	"Finally there are two last checkbox options. The first is "
	"<guilabel>Change cursor over links</guilabel>. If this option is "
	"selected, the shape of the cursor will change (usually to a hand) "
	"whenever it moves over a hyperlink. This makes it easy to identify "
	"links, especially when they are in the form of images."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:106
msgid	"Finally, the checkbox labeled <guilabel>Automatically load "
	"images</guilabel>, allows you to control whether images on web pages "
	"are loaded by default. Unless you have a very slow connection, you "
	"will probably want to leave this option selected, as there are many "
	"web pages that are difficult to use without images. If you don't "
	"select the option to automatically load images, you can still view "
	"the text on the page, and then load the images if you need them."

msgid	"Under this tab, you can select various options related to the use of "

	"design of a web page, you can select some default settings for "
	"&konqueror; to use."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:125
msgid	"The first thing you can set here is the font size. There are two "
	"settings which work together to allow you a comfortable browsing "
	"experience."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:129
msgid	"Firstly, you can set a <guilabel>Minimum Font Size</guilabel>. This "
	"means, even if the font size is set specifically in the page you are "
	"viewing, &konqueror; will ignore that instruction and never show "
	"smaller fonts than you set here."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:134
msgid	"Next you can set a <guilabel>Medium Font Size</guilabel>. This is "
	"not only the default size of text, used when the page doesn't "
	"specify sizes, but it is also used as the base size that relative "
	"font sizes are calculated against. That is, the "
	"<acronym>HTML</acronym> instruction <quote>smaller</quote>, it means "
	"smaller than the size you set for this option."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:141
msgid	"For either option, you can select the exact font size in points by "
	"using the up/down spin control (or just typing) next to the option "
	"label."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:145
msgid	"The remaining options are for the fonts to be associated with "
	"different types of markup used in <acronym>HTML</acronym> pages. "
	"Note that many web pages may override these settings. If you click "
	"anywhere on a control which shows a font name, a list of font names "
	"appears, and you can select a different font if you like. (If there "
	"are a lot of fonts, a vertical scrollbar appears in the list to "
	"allow you to scroll through all of the fonts.)"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:153
msgid	"You can set a font for each <quote>type</quote> of markup, for each "
	"<guilabel>Charset</guilabel>, by changing the character set in the "
	"first drop down box, and then selecting a font for each category "
	"below. This would take quite some time, so you may just want to set "
	"up the fonts for your default character set. Most English speaking "
	"users will use iso8859-1"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:160
msgid	"Below this, you can set a <guilabel>Font size adjustment for this "
	"encoding</guilabel>. Sometimes the fonts you want to use for a "
	"particular encoding or language are much larger or smaller than "
	"average, so you can use this setting to bring them into line."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:165
msgid	"You can set a default encoding that &konqueror; should assume pages "
	"are when rendering them. The default setting is <guilabel>Use "
	"language encoding</guilabel>, but you can change it to any encoding "
	"available in the list. You can even force the use of your default "
	"encoding using the <guilabel>Enforce default Encoding "
	"charset</guilabel>, in which case &konqueror; will ignore any "
	"language or charset from the page or server, and will use your "
	"setting."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:174

#: index.docbook:210
msgid	"Finally, the group of controls labeled <guilabel>Java Runtime "
	"Settings</guilabel> allows you to set some options for the way in "

	"Console</guilabel> option, &konqueror; will open a console window "
	"from which Java applications can read and write text. While most "
	"Java applications will not require such a console, it could be "
	"helpful in diagnosing problems with Java applications."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:218
msgid	"The <guilabel>Shutdown Applet Server when inactive</guilabel> "
	"checkbox allows you to save resources by closing the Java Applet "
	"Server when it is not in use, rather than leaving it running in the "
	"background. Leaving this disabled may make Java applets start up "
	"faster, but it will use system resources when you are not using a "
	"Java applet. If you enable this, you can set a timeout."

#: index.docbook:225
msgid	"You can either opt to have &konqueror; automatically detect the Java "
	"installation on your system, or specify the path to the installation "
	"yourself by selecting <guilabel>Use user-specified Java</guilabel>. "
	"You may want to choose the latter method, for instance, if you have "
	"multiple Java installations on your system, and want to specify "
	"which one to use. If the Java Virtual Machine you are using requires "
