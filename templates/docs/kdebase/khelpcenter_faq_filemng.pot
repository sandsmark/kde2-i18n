Pretty confusing, but it has been designed in that way so that it can integrate legacy, non-&kde; applications as smoothly as possible. &konqueror; when executing the line above will extend the command to <command>foo <option>-icon something.png -miniicon something_mini.png -caption \\\"The Foo\\\"</option></command>. Both the icon and the mini-icon as well as \"The Foo\" are properties defined in the <filename>.desktop</filename> file.

Instead, he expects a window called <guilabel>Editor</guilabel>. Furthermore these names are localized, <abbrev>i.e.</abbrev> an American user launches <guimenuitem>CD-Player</guimenuitem> and gets a window called <guilabel>CD-Player</guilabel> while a German user launches <guimenuitem>CD Spieler</guimenuitem> and gets a window called <guilabel>CD-Spieler</guilabel>."
