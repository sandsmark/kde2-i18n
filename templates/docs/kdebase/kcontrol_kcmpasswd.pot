msgid	"This module of the &kcontrol; gives you options for configuring the "
	"way in which the &kdesu; program treats passwords. &kdesu; will ask "
	"you for a password when you try to carry out some privileged "
	"actions, such as changing the date/time stored in your system clock, "
	"or adding new users on your computer."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:36
msgid	"Privileged actions such as those described above can only be carried "
	"out by root or a user with administrator permissions on your system. "
	"You will need to enter the password for the root account when you "

msgid	"There are two configuration options for passwords. The first is to "
	"control the visual feedback that you receive when you type a "
	"password. The actual characters in the password are never shown on "
	"the screen. You can choose to have each character represented by a "
	"<token>*</token> character. If you want to make it harder for "
	"someone who might be watching your screen to figure out how many "
	"characters there are in the password, you can choose to have each "
	"character in the password be represented by three asterisks rather "
	"than just one. Still another option is not to have any visual "
	"feedback at all, so nothing appears on the screen when you type a "
	"password."

	"5 and 1200 minutes, or use the arrows on the spinner.)"
