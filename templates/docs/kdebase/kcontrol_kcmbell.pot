msgid	"The system bell or beep is a feature of the X server, which attempts "

msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:35
msgid	"It isn't always possible for the X server to actually make a beep "
	"sound with exactly the parameters selected due to hardware "
	"limitations. For example, on most PCs, volume control is not very "
	"good so the X server seems to fake low volume with a reduced "
	"duration of the sound. Thus, if the settings don't seem to do "
	"anything, this is because the X server and/or the hardware don't "
	"support anything better."
