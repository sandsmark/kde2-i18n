	"components. While it is possible to just browse the manuals until "
	"you find that piece of information you're looking for, this may be a "
	"very time-consuming task. To make this easier for you, KDE offers "
	"fulltext search using a program called "
	"<application>ht://dig</application>. It works quite similar to "
	"search engines on the web, in fact some search engines you now might "
	"even use it. Just click on the \"<guilabel>Search</guilabel>\" tab "
	"in the KDE Help Center, enter the word you are looking for, click "
