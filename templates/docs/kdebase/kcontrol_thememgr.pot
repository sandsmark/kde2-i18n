msgid	"On the left, you can see a list of themes that &kde; is aware of. "
	"Selecting one of the names will change the preview image in the "
	"middle of the pane, to give you a small taste of what the theme "
	"looks like. Any information the author has provided about the theme, "

msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:46
msgid	"The <guibutton>Save As...</guibutton> button allows you to save an "

	"that you use this if you intend creating themes by hand, you can get "
	"very unexpected results if there are errors in a theme file."

msgid	"<guibutton>Create</guibutton> will create a theme that contains your "

#: index.docbook:57
msgid	"Finally, it's very easy to collect a lot of themes that look rather "

msgid	"For example, the <quote>Eclipse</quote> theme that comes with a base "
	"&kde; installation contains contents for all the configurable items, "

	"The <quote>MGBreizh</quote> theme, contains contents for everything "

	"find in the kdeartwork package, contains <emphasis>only</emphasis> "

msgid	"You have two choices here. You can check the <guilabel>Uninstall "

	"will be entirely removed before the new one is installed. Or you "
	"could just install the <quote>Default</quote> theme, which really "
	"isn't a theme, it's more of a theme cleaner - it removes all other "
