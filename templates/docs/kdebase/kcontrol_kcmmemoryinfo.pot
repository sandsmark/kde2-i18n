msgid	"The first thing you must understand, is there are two types of "
	"<quote>memory</quote>, available to the operating system and the "
	"programs that run within it."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:39
msgid	"The first type, is called physical memory. This is the memory "
	"located within the memory chips, within your computer. This is the "
	"<acronym>RAM</acronym> (for Random Acess Memory) you bought when you "
	"purchased your computer."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:44
msgid	"The second type of memory, is called virtual or swap memory. This "
	"block of memory, is actually space on the hard drive. The operating "
	"system reserves a space on the hard drive for <quote>swap "
	"space</quote>. The operating system can use this virtual memory (or "
	"swap space), if it runs out of physical memory. The reason this is "
	"called <quote>swap</quote> memory, is the operating system takes "
	"some data that it doesn't think you will want for a while, and saves "
	"that to disk in this reserved space. The operating system then loads "
	"the new data you need right now. It has <quote>swapped</quote> the "
	"not needed data, for the data you need right now. Virtual or swap "
	"memory is not as fast as physical memory, so operating systems try "
	"to keep data (especially often used data), in the physical memory."

msgid	"Also, if your computer seems sluggish: Is your physical memory full, "
	"and is the hard drive always seem to be running? This suggests that "
	"you do not have enough physical memory, and your computer is relying "
	"on the slower virtual memory for commonly used data. Increasing your "
	"physical memory will improve the responsivness of your computer."
