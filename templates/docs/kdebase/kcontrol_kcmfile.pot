msgid	"Introduction"

#: index.docbook:25
msgid	"One of the most convenient aspects of &kde;, is its ability to "
	"automatically match a data file, with its application. As an "
	"example, when you click on your favorite &kword; document in "
	"&konqueror;, &kde; automatically starts &kword;, and automatically "
	"loads that file into &kword; so you can begin working on it."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:31
msgid	"In the example above, the &kword; Data file, is "
	"<emphasis>associated</emphasis> with &kword; (the application). "
	"These file associations are crucial to the functioning of &kde;."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:35
msgid	"When &kde; is installed, it automatically creates hundreds of file "
	"associations to many of the most common data types. These initial "
	"associations are based on the most commonly included software, and "
	"the most common user preferences."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:40

#: index.docbook:48
msgid	"You can change your current file associations or add new file "
	"associations using this module."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:51
msgid	"Each file association is recorded as a mime type. "
	"<acronym>MIME</acronym> stands for <quote>Multipurpose Internet Mail "

msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:80
msgid	"There is no functional difference between any of the categories. "
	"These categories are designed to help organize your file "

#: index.docbook:85
msgid	"The categories are listed in the box labeled <guilabel>Known "

msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:88
msgid	"You can explore each of these categories, and see the file "
	"associations contained within each one, by simply double clicking on "
	"the category name. You will be presented with a list of the "
	"associated mime-types under that category."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:93
msgid	"You can also search for a particular mime-type by using the search "
	"box. The search box is labeled <guilabel>Find filename "
	"pattern</guilabel> and is located above the category list."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:93
msgid	"Simply type the first letter of the mime-type you are interested in. "
	"The categories are automatically expanded, and only the mime-types "

msgid	"You should enter your filename mask in this combo box."

#: index.docbook:198
msgid	"The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that will be used with "

	"beyond the scope of this manual, but it is important to understand "
	"that the asterisk (in this context), <quote>matches</quote> any "
	"number of characters. As an example: <userinput>*.pdf</userinput> "
	"will match <filename>Datafile.pdf</filename>, "
	"<filename>Graphics.pdf</filename> and <filename>User.pdf</filename>, "
	"but not <filename>PDF</filename>, <filename>Datafile.PDF</filename>, "
	"or <filename>.pdf</filename>."

msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:230
msgid	"The combo box lists all of the applications associated with a "
	"specific mime-type. The list is in a specific order. The top "

	"down the list is the second, etc."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:235
msgid	"What do you mean there is more than one application per mime-type? "
	"Why is this necessary?"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:235
msgid	"We started out by saying that &kde; comes preconfigured with "
	"hundreds of file associations. The reality is, each system that "
	"&kde; is installed on has a different selection of applications. By "
	"allowing multiple associations per mime-type, KDE can continue to "
	"operate when a certain application is not installed on the system."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:235
msgid	"As an example:"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:235
msgid	"For the mime type <literal>pdf</literal>, there are two applications "
	"associated with this file type. The first program is called "
	"<application>PS Viewer</application>. If your system does not have "
	"<application>PS Viewer</application> installed, then &kde; "
	"automatically starts the second application <application>Adobe "
	"Acrobat Reader</application>. As you can see, this will help keep "
	"&kde; running strong as you add and subtract applications."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:253
msgid	"We have established that the order is important. You can change the "
	"order of the applications by clicking once with the mouse on the "
	"application you want to move, and then clicking either "
	"<guibutton>Move Up</guibutton> or <guibutton>Move Down</guibutton>. "
	"This will shift the currently selected application up or down the "
	"list of applications."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:260
msgid	"You can add new applications to the list by clicking the button "
	"labeled <guibutton>Add</guibutton>. A dialog box will appear. Using "
	"the dialog box, you can select the application you want to use for "
	"this mime type. Click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> when you are done, "
	"and the application will be added to the current list."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:266
msgid	"You can remove an application (thereby ensuring that the application "
	"will never run with this mime-type by clicking once on the name of "
	"the application, and clicking the <guibutton>Remove</guibutton> "
	"button."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:271
msgid	"It is a good idea to use the <guibutton>Move Up</guibutton> and "
	"<guibutton>Move Down</guibutton> buttons to adjust the unwanted "
	"application to a lower position in the list, rather than deleting "
	"the application from the list entirely. Once you have deleted an "
	"application, if your preferred application should become "
	"compromised, there will not be an application to view the data "
