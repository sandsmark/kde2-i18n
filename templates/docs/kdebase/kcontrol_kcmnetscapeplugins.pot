msgid	"As &Netscape;'s <application>Navigator</application> has been a web "
	"browsing standard for many years, so-called &Netscape; plugins have "
	"appeared that allow rich web content. Using those plugins, web sites "
	"can contain <acronym>PDF</acronym> files, flash animations, video "
	"&etc; With &konqueror;, you can still use these plugins to take "
	"advantage of rich web content."

msgid	"&konqueror; has to know where your &Netscape; plugins are installed. "
	"This can be in several places, &ie; you might have system-wide "
	"plugins in <filename "

	"personal plugins in <filename "
	"class=\"directory\">$<envar>HOME</envar>/.netscape/plugins</filename>"
	". However, &konqueror; will not automatically use the installed "
	"plugins: it first has to scan a list of directories. You can "
	"initiate the scan by clicking <guibutton>Scan for new "
	"plugins</guibutton>. Or you can enable <guilabel>Scan for new "
	"plugins at KDE startup</guilabel> so &konqueror; will on every &kde; "
	"startup scan the appropriate directories to see whether new plugins "
	"have been installed."

msgid	"To find plugins, &konqueror; will look in the directories specified "

	"this control module for the first time, this list will already be "
	"filled with reasonable paths that should work on most operating "
	"systems. If you need to provide a new path, click the "
	"<guibutton>New</guibutton> button; then you can either enter the new "
	"path in the text edit box to the left, or choose a directory using "
	"the file dialog by clicking the <guibutton>...</guibutton> button. "
	"As scanning the directories can take a little time, you might want "
	"to remove directories from the list where you know that no plugins "
	"are installed: do this by selecting a directory and clicking "
	"<guibutton>Remove</guibutton>. Using the <guibutton>Up</guibutton> "
	"and <guibutton>Down</guibutton> buttons you can change the order in "
