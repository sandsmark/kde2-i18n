msgid	"Sometimes it is reassuring to know that your computer didn't just "
	"ignore your command, and something is happening behind the scenes. "
	"In this module you can configure visible feedback to help you know "
	"if you really hit that icon or not."

#: index.docbook:33
msgid	"The traditional way to indicate that your computer is busy is to "
	"modify the cursor, and you can turn this on by checking the "
	"<guilabel>Enable Busy Cursor</guilabel> checkbox."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:37
msgid	"With this option enabled, your cursor will have an icon attached to "
	"it for a short time, when a new application is being launched. You "
	"can configure how long this icon displays by your cursor with the "
	"<guilabel>Startup indication timeout (seconds):</guilabel> spinbox. "
	"The default is 15 seconds."

#: index.docbook:43
msgid	"If the default cursor is not eye catching enough, or you just want a "
	"more visible reminder, you can <guilabel>Enable blinking</guilabel>, "
	"in which case the busy cursor icon will be animated."

msgid	"Traditional &kde; launch notification has taken another form, which "
	"you can also enable and disable here. Normally when you start an "
	"application, it gets an immediate entry in the taskbar, with the "
	"icon replaced by a spinning &kde; gear to let you know something is "
	"happening. You can toggle this behaviour on and off with the "
	"<guilabel>Enable Taskbar Notification</guilabel> checkbox, and when "
	"it's enabled, you can set a time in the <guilabel>Startup indication "
	"timeout (seconds):</guilabel> spinbox."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:56
msgid	"Not all applications that you start will eventually show a window, "
	"or an entry in the taskbar. Some of them for example, are docked "
	"into the &kde; system tray, or it might be that you sent it off to a "
	"different virtual desktop, and you don't display all open tasks on "
	"your current desktop taskbar. Setting a timeout ensures that even in "
	"these cases, you can still get launch feedback, but also that it "
	"will go away when the job is done."
