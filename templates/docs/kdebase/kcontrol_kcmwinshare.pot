	"local files, for example in the &konqueror; file manager and in the "
	"file dialog. To make use of this you should provide &kde; with some "
	"information on your <acronym>SMB</acronym> network. But don't worry, "
	"this is normally pretty simple as for example all the Windows "

	"authentificate yourself to access the services of an "

	"itself on <acronym>SMB</acronym> hosts. If you let the field "
	"<guilabel>Default user name</guilabel> empty, &kde; will try to "
	"access <acronym>SMB</acronym> hosts without a username. If you let "
