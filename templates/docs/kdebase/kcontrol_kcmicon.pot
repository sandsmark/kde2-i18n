msgid	"&kde; comes with a full set of icons in several sizes. These icons "
	"are being used all over &kde;: desktop, panel, the &konqueror; file "
	"manager, in every toolbar of every &kde; application, etc. The icons "
	"control module offers you very flexible ways of customizing the way "

	"<guilabel>Effects</guilabel> tab (don't worry about that now, we'll "
	"explain that below)."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:90
msgid	"When you want to configure icons, first select the usage of icons "
	"you want to configure. Change the settings until you like the "
	"preview. You can then choose a different icon usage and configure "

msgstr	""

msgid	"Icon Size"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:103
msgid	"You have two options relating to icon sizes. First, you can choose "
	"of a list of icon sizes. Second, you can tell &kde; to draw all "
	"pixels using double sized pixels. The largest icon sizes are "
	"especially useful for visually impaired people."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:108
msgid	"Which sizes will be offered by the icon size listbox depends on the "
	"icon theme you have selected in the icon themes control module. For "
	"example, the low color icon theme only offers the sizes 16 and 32 "
	"for desktop icons and 16, 22 and 32 for toolbar icons. The high "
	"color theme offers icon sizes 16, 32 and 48 as well as sizes from 64 "
	"to 128. However, as &kde; can not have all these icon sizes in "
	"store, icons using size 64 to 128 will be automatically generated "
	"which may result in a loss of quality."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:117
msgid	"If the icon sizes offered by your chosen icon theme are not enough "
	"for you, there's still the option <guilabel>Double sized "
	"pixels</guilabel>. If this option is selected, all icons will have "
	"double sized pixels, &ie; a 2x2 block instead of normal pixels. "
	"While this makes it possible to achieve very large icon sizes, the "
	"quality is poor: icons will look <quote>blocky</quote>, an effect "
	"you may remember if you've grown up using a Sinclair ZX Spectrum or "
	"similar. If this is an option for you, using the large sizes offerd "
	"by &kde;'s high color icon theme will always result in a much better "
	"quality than using the low color icon theme with double sized pixels."
