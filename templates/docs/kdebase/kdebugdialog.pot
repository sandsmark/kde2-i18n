msgid	"What is KDebugDialog"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:42
msgid	"It is a dialog box for managing diagnostic messages at runtime."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:45
msgid	"If you simply start \"kdebugdialog\", you will see a list of "
	"\"areas\", that can be disabled or enabled. A kdDebug(area) call in "
	"the code will show something in the debug output only if the area is "
	"enabled."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:50
msgid	"Note that kdWarning, kdError and kdFatal always appear, they are NOT "
	"controlled by this setting."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:55
msgid	"If you start \"kdebugdialog --fullmode\", you can define separately "
	"for every severity level what should be done with the diagnostic "
	"messages of that level, and this for each debug area."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:60
msgid	"In the full mode, the following settings are available:"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:60
msgid	"Output: In this Combobox, you can choose where the messages should "
	"be output. The choices are: \"File\", \"Message Box\", \"Shell\" "
	"(meaning stderr) and \"syslog\". Please do not direct fatal messages "
	"to syslog unless you are the system administrator yourself. The "
	"default is \"Message Box\"."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:60
msgid	"File: This is only meaningful when you have chosen \"File\" as the "
	"output and provides the name of that file (which is interpreted "
	"relatively to the current directory). The default is kdebug.dbg."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:60
msgid	"Area: The areas which should only be output. Every message that is "
	"not mentioned here will simply not be output (unless this field "
	"remains empty which is the default and means that all messages "
	"should be output). Your can enter several areas separated by commas "
	"here, and you can also use area ranges with the syntax start-end. "
	"Thus a valid entry could be: 117,214-289,356-359,221. Please do not "
	"use whitespace."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:88
msgid	"Apart from this, you can also tick the checkbox \"Abort on fatal "
	"errors\". In this case, if a diagnostic message with the severity "
	"level \"KDEBUG_FATAL\" is output, the application aborts with a "
	"SIGABRT after outputting the message."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:94
msgid	"When you close the dialog with OK, your entries apply immediately "
	"and saved in kdebugrc. When you press cancel, your entries are "
	"discarded and the old ones are restored."
