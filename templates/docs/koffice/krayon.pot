msgid	"&krayon; is a full featured image manipulation program. You can use "
	"&krayon; for all your image creation and editing needs, such as "
	"making web images, touching up scanned photographs, creating "
	"original art, or anything else you might need to do with bitmapped "
	"images."

#: index.docbook:68
msgid	"What makes &krayon; different, and special, is ease of use compared "
	"with other high-end applications, and full integration with "
	"&koffice; and &kde;. Because of this, &krayon; supports drag and "
	"drop, themes, embedding, and many other advanced features you expect "
	"from a modern desktop environment. Ease of use is important to "
	"amateur users, but even more important to professional artists who "
	"must spend many hours a day using such applications to work with "
	"images."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:76
msgid	"&krayon; is primarily a painting program with some image processing "
	"capabilities. More capabilities can be added with plugins. Using "
	"native and foreign plugins, and parts which can reuse other &kde; "
	"components, additional tools and utilities can be added as needed."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:82
msgid	"&krayon; uses &XML; as its native file format. This allows import "
	"filters for almost every type of image file format to be easily "
	"created. It also allows other programs to more easily import "
	"&krayon; files."
