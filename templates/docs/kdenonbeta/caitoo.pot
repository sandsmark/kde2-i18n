msgid	"Caitoo ( formerly known as KGet ) is a download manager similar to "
	"Go!zilla(tm) or GetRight Download(tm)."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:40
msgid	"It keeps all your downloads in one dialog. Program supports drag "
	"&amp; drop from KDE applications or Netscape. You can easily drop "
	"url's from kfm or Netscape onto main window or onto docking window. "
	"Transfer will register on the list and you can simply organize them "
	"( add, delete, stop, resume, move around on the list). Status window "
	"shows size of each transfer, current progress in percents, current "
	"transfer speed and estimated time to finishing of transfer."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:48
msgid	"Caitoo, as well as kfm is utilizing libkio and kioslaves. This "
	"allows using of many sophisticated features like <link "

	"setting timeouts for read operations etc."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:53
msgid	"Users can set retry count for transfer, schedule it for later start "
	"or simply add transfers to the list without starting them. Caitoo "
	"also supports <link linkend=\"queueing\">queueing</link>. Transfer "
	"list can be exported to / imported from file, and this list can be "
	"set to autosave every X minutes. Other features include "
	"auto-disconnecting, auto-shutdown, auto-paste and also expert mode "
	"for experienced users."

msgid	"Resuming"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:176
msgid	"Caitoo supports resuming, which is a feature supported by most of "

	"some big file and after 75&percnt; of download connection error "
	"occurs, you do not have to start all over again, but simply register "
	"this transfer again and it will continue in the place where it "

	"it )."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:183
msgid	"However, this feature does not work for all ftp and http servers. "

msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:201
msgid	"If some error occurs while starting transfer or while transfering, "
	"Caitoo will not show you the error message, but it will set transfer "
	"for retry without asking. This is very useful, if you drag many "

msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:207

	"do not have to remember the URL of the file anymore - Caitoo will "
