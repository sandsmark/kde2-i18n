msgid	"&kautorun; is a KDE tool that provides autorun capabilities for "
	"CD-ROM/DVD drives. The tool runs in the background and checks the CD "
	"drive regularly to find out if a new disc has been inserted. If yes, "
	"it checks the type of the disc. If it is an audio disc, it starts "
	"playing the audio tracks. If it is a data disc, the disc is "
	"automounted and displayed in KDE's file manager."
