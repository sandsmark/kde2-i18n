msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:39
msgid	"KBiff is a mail notification utility for the KDE project. It has "
	"several advantages over much of its competition:"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:39
msgid	"<emphasis>Pure GUI configuration</emphasis>. No more command line "
	"parameters to remember (well, one optional one to make things easier "
	"for some people) or strange config files. All settings for KBiff can "
	"be done from one setup dialog."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:39
msgid	"<emphasis>Session Management</emphasis>. KBiff starts up with the "
	"same configuration you left it with."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:39
msgid	"<emphasis>Panel Docking</emphasis>. KBiff can be docked into the "
	"panel very easily. Handy when you are monitoring several mailboxes "
	"and don't have room anywhere else."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:39
msgid	"<emphasis>Animated GIFs</emphasis>. You can use animated GIFs as "
	"your icons."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:39
msgid	"<emphasis>Sounds</emphasis>. KBiff has an option to play .wav files "
	"when new mail arrives."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:39
msgid	"<emphasis>POP3, IMAP4, NNTP, Maildir, MBOX, MH</emphasis>. KBiff "
	"supports all major mailbox formats!"

msgid	"<emphasis>Multiple Mailbox</emphasis>. KBiff can monitor several "
	"mailboxes with one instance."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:187
msgid	"To choose a time other than the default, here, it is a good idea to "
	"analyze the frequency in which your mail arrives. If, for instance, "
	"you have <literal>fetchmail</literal> downloading new mail every 5 "
	"minutes, then it doesn't make sense to set the time for less than "
	"that. On the other hand, if you are using the POP3 or IMAP4 feature "
	"of KBiff, you should probably use a higher interval. Setting it less "
