#: index.docbook:101
msgid	"The hosts are checked using <acronym>ICMP</acronym> echo requests. "
	"To be able to send and receive <acronym>ICMP</acronym> echo requests "
	"and replies the program has to open a so-called <quote>raw "
	"socket</quote>. Therefore it needs <systemitem "

#: index.docbook:115
msgid	"Since the <acronym>ICMP</acronym> requests and the broadcasts can "
	"cause some network traffic if there are more than one such server "
	"running in one network, the servers cooperate with each other. "
	"Before they start pinging (or <command>nmblookup</command>), they "

msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:126
msgid	"If nobody answers, the host which sent the broadcast will start "
	"pinging the hosts (or <command>nmblookup</command>) and then open a "
	"socket which listens for the mentioned broadcasts. If the host "
	"received an answer to his broadcast, it won't have the socket for "

	"increase up to 160 minutes, almost three hours. If then somebody "
	"accesses the data from the server, he will get an old list ( up to "
	"160 minutes old). With accessing the server will reset its update "
	"interval to its initial value, &ie; 10 minutes and immediatly start "
