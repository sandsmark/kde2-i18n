	"transfer limit, and then charge more for every megabyte above this "
	"limit. &kppp; shows you your current volume and can help you keep "
	"your bills to the minimum. Of course, even if you're not billed "
	"based on volume, you can turn on volume accounting just to satisfy "
	"your own curiosity."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:730
msgid	"What type of volume accounting should I select?"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:732
msgid	"That depends mainly on your provider. Many of them only count how "
	"many megabytes you download from the Internet,and ignore how much "
	"you send. In that case you should choose <guilabel>Bytes "
	"In</guilabel>. If you have to pay for both, you should choose "
	"<guilabel>Bytes In and Out</guilabel>. <guilabel>Bytes "
	"Out</guilabel> is really only here for completeness, as we're not "
	"aware of any providers using it as a billing basis. It might be "

msgid	"Drawbacks"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:745
msgid	"Unfortunately, there is a drawback on volume accounting. &kppp; will "
	"only count the number of bytes, regardless of their origin. Many "
	"providers set their limit only for Internet access, and not for data "
	"on their own network. Some providers set different limits for data "
	"that is on their own network, in the same country, and coming from "
	"overseas. So, if you're doing not much websurfing, and getting most "
	"of your pages from your <acronym>ISP</acronym>'s own proxy cache, "
	"then your provider is probably not charging you for that data. "
	"&kppp; will not know these <acronym>IP</acronym> packets are coming "
	"from the proxy, and so it will count them. So if you this situation "
	"applies to you, or, as another example, your provider uses a caching "
	"news server such as <application>nntpcached</application>, then the "
	"volume reported by &kppp; may be higher than the amount you are "
	"going to be billed for. On the bright side, at least &kppp; will "
	"never underestimate your bills."
