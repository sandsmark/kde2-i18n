#: index.docbook:170
msgid	"This complete order of cards is called a family. There are real "

#: index.docbook:193
msgid	"1. Talon"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:193
msgid	"In the beginning of each game all cards are mixed in the deck. But "
	"not in every game all cards are dealt out, but some reside in the "
	"deck. These cards are put down on the so called talon, which you can "
	"find quite easy as it is in most games the only pile showing the "
	"reverse."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:193
msgid	"If no card shows the reverse side, all cards are dealt out and there "
	"is no talon. These card games are the hardest as there is no "

	"to blame"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:193
msgid	"2. Waste Pile"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:193
msgid	"Many games put cards from the talon first on a waste pile when you "
	"click on the reverse of the top card on the talon."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:193
msgid	"From there you can take the card (which is then face up) and put it "

msgid	"3. Foundation"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:193
msgid	"The foundation piles is where you want to have your cards in the "
	"end. If all cards end up there in the right order, you've won."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:193
msgid	"In most card games these piles are empty in the beginning, but "
	"&kpat; drops cards there when it sees them fitting to save you this "
	"most often boring part."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:193
msgid	"4. Playing Piles"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:193
msgid	"These piles are the ones where the actual reordering happens. The "
	"rules for these piles vary a lot between the games. Some show all "
	"cards on them, some not. Some allow only card to be removed, some "
	"allow every card to be removed, etc. See the following chapters for "
	"details."

msgid	"Klondike is the most famous patience - most likely because an often "
	"used operating system comes with it. It is played with one deck."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:273
msgid	"Goal of Klondike is to put all cards as real families ascending on "
	"the foundation. This works usually pretty well as soon as all cards "
	"are lying face up in the playing piles."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:279
msgid	"The sequences on the playing piles have to be put there descending "
	"while the cards should alternate in colors (red and black). You can "
	"move whole sequences or parts of it if the first card fits on "
	"another pile."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:285
msgid	"On a free pile you can put a king of any color or a sequence "
	"starting with a king."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:290
msgid	"When you click on the talon, one card from will be moved to the "
	"waste pile, from where you can move it to the playing piles or the "
	"foundation. Is the talon empty, you can move the complete waste pile "
	"on the talon in clicking on the empty talon."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:297
msgid	"You can look through the cards on the talon without any limit, but "
	"you should learn fast that you've lost if you can't find one card to "
	"move and that a new shift doesn't help you in finding new solutions."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:305
msgid	"Grandfather"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:308
msgid	"This game has been introduced to Paul by his grandfather, so it got "

	"this patience game."

#: index.docbook:314
msgid	"Grandfather deals one deck to seven playing piles while some cards "
	"on each pile are face down on initial deal."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:319
msgid	"The goal is to put all cards as real families ascending on the "
	"foundations."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:323
msgid	"You can move every card on every pile if it fits on another card to "
	"build a real sequence with descending order. For example you can "
	"move the five of spades on top of the six of spades, no matter how "
	"many cards on are on top of the five of spades. Just the six of "
	"spades has to be on top of its pile."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:330
msgid	"On a free pile you can place a king (again no matter how many cards "
	"are on top of it)"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:335
msgid	"If no more cards can be moved, you can re-deal up to two times. All "
	"cards already in the foundations stay there, but the cards in the "
	"playing piles are reordered to give you a new chance to find a "
	"solution."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:341
msgid	"Even though the rules are simple and allow quite some moves, the "
	"game is still hard to win, but is still a joy to play (or because of "
	"that)."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:348
msgid	"Aces up"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:350
msgid	"This patience has very simple rules, but is still hard to win. It is "
	"played with one deck and the goal is to put all cards beside the "
	"aces to the foundation. After that there should be an ace on every "
	"playing pile left."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:356
msgid	"Each top card that is of the same color (&eg; spades) and has a "
	"lower value than another top card (&eg; six of spades and four of "
	"spades) can be put on the foundation by clicking on it."

	"new card for each playing pile in clicking on the talon."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:367
msgid	"On a free pile you can move every other card on top of a pile. You "
	"should choose these moves to free piles the way that new cards can "
	"be moved to the foundation after that."
msgstr	""

msgstr	""

msgid	"Freecell is playing with one card deck. You have four free cells in "
	"the left top corner. Beside that there are the four foundation piles "
	"and below it there are eight playing piles."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:388
msgid	"The goal of the game is to have all cards as real families ascending "
	"on the foundation. This works quite often if you know how to play as "
	"Freecell is solvable at a rate of 99.9% approximately (of the first "
	"32000 deals there is only one unsolvable - 11982 if you want to "
	"know)."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:395
msgid	"In the playing piles you have to build descending sequences, where "
	"red and black cards alternate. In a free cell you can put any card."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:400
msgid	"You can only move one single card that lays on top of a pile or a "
	"free cell. Sequences can only be moved if you have enough free room "
	"(free cells or free playing piles) to put the cards in between you "
	"move."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:406
msgid	"The moving of sequences will be supported by &kpat; if there is "
	"enough room. The maximum of cards you can move is calculated by:"

msgid	"(#{free cells} + 1) * 2<superscript>#{free piles}</superscript>"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:414
msgid	"To solve this game it is recommended to grab the cards out of the "
	"playing sequences in the same order they have to be put into the "
	"foundation (first the aces, then the twos, &etc;)"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:420

	"colors or suits."

msgid	"The foundation is made out of five piles, that are put as an X. On "
	"the four corners of this X you have to build sequences starting with "
	"seven and ending with king."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:441
msgid	"The pile in the middle takes four times the sequence from six down "
	"to ace. The color doesn't matter for all five piles."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:446
msgid	"The other four piles on the sides of the pile in the middle (or in "
	"between the X - however you want to put it) can take one card each "
