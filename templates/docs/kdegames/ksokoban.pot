#: index.docbook:55
msgid	"The first sokoban game was created in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi at "
	"the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. &quot;Sokoban&quot; is "
	"japanese for &quot;warehouse keeper&quot;. The idea is that you are "
	"a warehouse keeper trying to push crates to their proper locations "
	"in a warehouse."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:63
msgid	"The problem is that you cannot pull the crates or step over them. If "
	"you are not careful, some of the crates can get stuck in wrong "
	"places and/or block your way."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:69
msgid	"It can be rather difficult just to solve a level. But if you want to "
	"make it even harder, you can try to minimise the number of moves "
	"and/or pushes you use to solve the level."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:75
msgid	"To make the game more fun for small kids (below 10 years or so), "
	"some collections with easier levels are also included in &ksokoban;. "
	"These are marked <emphasis>(easy)</emphasis> in the level collection "
	"menu. Of course, these levels can be fun for adults too, for example "
	"if you don't want to expose yourself to too much mental strain."

msgid	"The Game"
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:87
msgid	"The objective of the game is to push all the red gems to the goal "
	"squares, which are marked with green glassy round things on the "
	"floor."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:92
msgid	"Use the cursor keys or the mouse to move about. If you move onto a "
	"gem using the cursor keys or the middle mouse button, and there is "
	"noting blocking it on the opposite side, then you will push the gem. "
	"It isn't possible to pull the gems, so if you push a gem into a "
	"corner it will be stuck there. You can't step over the gems either, "
	"so you can also get trapped in a part of the maze by blocking the "
	"way with gems. Also note that it isn't possible to push more than "
	"one gem at a time."
msgstr	""

#: index.docbook:102
msgid	"If you notice that you have moved the gems in such a way that the "
	"level is impossible to solve, then you can always use the undo "
	"feature to go back to a position where the mistake has not yet been "
	"made. You can of course also restart the level from the very "
	"beginning."
