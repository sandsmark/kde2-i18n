msgid "The Samba and NFS Status Monitor is a front end to the programs <em>smbstatus</em> and <em>showmount</em>. Smbstatus reports on current Samba connections, and is part of the suite of Samba tools, which implements the SMB (Session Message Block) protocol, also called the NetBIOS or LanManager protocol. This protocol can be used to provide printer sharing or drive sharing services on a network including machines running the various flavors of Microsoft Windows.<p> Showmount is part of the NFS software package. NFS stands for Network File System and is the traditional UNIX way to share directories over the network. In this case the output of <em>showmount -a localhost</em> is parsed. On some systems showmount is in /usr/sbin, check if you have showmount in your PATH."
