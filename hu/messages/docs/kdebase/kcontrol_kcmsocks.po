"SOCKS is a protocol to execute proxy requests for a client. SOCKS is capable "
"of authentication and encryption of traffic, and is often found in corporate "
"settings, as opposed to home users. For more information about SOCKS, see "
"the <ulink url=\"http://www.socks.nec.com\">NEC</ulink> website"

"Setting up of a SOCKS client is outside the scope of this document, and the "
"differences between the commonly used ones are very large. If you already "
"have a working SOCKS implementation, allowing you to use commandline clients "
"(for example, if <command>lynx</command> or <command>ftp</command> are "
"already working) then you can simply check the <guilabel>Enable SOCKS "
"support</guilabel> checkbox."

"First, you should select which of the various SOCKS clients you have "
"installed on your computer. &kde; will attempt to find this out by itself, "
"if you choose <guilabel>Auto detect</guilabel>. If you know the client you "
"have, you could choose either <guilabel>Use NEC Socks</guilabel> or "
"<guilabel>Use Dante</guilabel>. If you have a custom built SOCKS library to "
"use, you can select <guilabel>Use custom library</guilabel> and then enter "
"the path to it in the <guilabel>Path</guilabel> field."

"If you want &kde; to auto detect the SOCKS library in use, but you suspect "
"it isn't looking in the right places or you have installed it in a "
