msgid ""
"KDE is a desktop environment. In other words, KDE is a collection of "
"programs, technologies and documentation that attempt to make life easier "
"for the computer users. KDE is targeted to Unix workstations. It features "
"network transparency and a contemporary work philosophy."
msgstr ""
"KDE je grafičko okruženje. Drugim rečima, kde je kolekcija programa, "
"tehnologija i dokumentacije koja pokušava da olakša život korisnicima "
"računara. KDE je namenjen Unix radnim stanicama. Njega karakteriše mrežna "
"transparencija i moderna filozofija rada."

"The creators of the K Desktop environment are a world-wide group of software "

"Tvorac K Desktop Enviroment-a je grupa softverskih inženjera "
"rasprostranjenih širom sveta. Glavni cilj ove grupe u razvoju otvorenog "

"ima laku kontrolu nad resursima svog račnunara."

"KDE seeks to fill the need for an easy to use desktop for Unix workstations, "
"similar to the desktop environments found under the MacOS or Window95/NT. "
"KDE fills the need of users for an easy to use work environment. Tools used "
"to reach this end are: enhanced inter application communication, component "
"reuse, generalized drag and drop, uniform look and feel and many more. Thus, "
"KDE offers much more than the traditional Unix window managers."

"Stability, scaleabitilty and openness are qualities which have made Unix the "
"undisputed choice for the information technology professional for many "
"years. KDE builds on top of this excellent base framework and brings new, "
"much needed qualities: usability, user friendliness and beauty! KDE was the "
"first and stays the forefront player into bringing these qualities to Unix. "

"Without Unix the internet would not exist, or at least would have a vastly "
"different form. Unix has not, until now, addressed the needs of the average "
"computer user. This fact is particularly unfortunate, since a number of "
"implementations of Unix (<ulink url=\"http://www.linux.org\">Linux</ulink>, "
"<ulink url=\"http://www.freebsd.org\">FreeBSD</ulink>, <ulink "
"url=\"http://www.netbsd.org\">NetBSD</ulink>, etc) are freely available on "

"KDE focuses on the user's needs, but it's obvious that this focus is more "

"Authoring applications under Unix/X11 used to be an extremely tedious and "
